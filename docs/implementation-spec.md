# Honestly MVP Implementation Spec

This file is the source of truth for Phase 1 implementation.

## Scope
- Build the Honestly MVP in Next.js App Router with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.
- Use hardcoded data only through typed mock data and service layers.
- Keep UI components data-agnostic so data sources can be swapped to Supabase later with minimal refactor.

## Architecture Rules
- No hardcoded dataset literals inside page/component files.
- Domain models live in `/lib/types`.
- Mock datasets live in `/lib/mock-data`.
- Async-like data access functions live in `/lib/services`.
- Prefer server components for static page shells; use client components for interactive elements.
- Use local component state only where interaction requires it.
- Add automated tests as features are built to reduce UI and service-layer regressions.

## Data Layer Contract
- Services expose async signatures (e.g. `getVendors()`, `getVendorBySlug(slug)`) even when in-memory.
- Mock auth session uses a `MockSession` with `user` and `role` fields.
- Mock implementations sit behind a swappable data-layer contract so future providers can replace them without changing page/component imports.
- Future migration path:
  1. Keep same service function signatures.
  2. Swap mock implementations for Supabase-backed implementations.
  3. Keep UI unchanged.

## Search Architecture
- Phase 1 search should stay service-contract-first, not API-route-first.
- Homepage search should provide lightweight grouped suggestions for vendors, categories, and locations.
- Vendors page search should use the same service layer for query/filter-driven result updates.
- Search guardrails:
  1. Debounce input by 200–300ms.
  2. Require at least 2–3 characters before querying.
  3. Limit suggestions to 5–8 results per group.
  4. Ignore stale responses when newer input is in flight.
- Target suggestion contract:

```ts
type SearchSuggestions = {
  vendors: { id: string; name: string; slug: string }[];
  categories: { id: string; name: string; slug: string }[];
  locations: { city: string; region?: string }[];
};
```

## Route Plan
- Public: `/`, `/vendors`, `/vendor/[slug]`, `/category/[slug]`, `/category/[slug]/[subcategorySlug]`, `/lists/[shareSlug]`
- User/Auth: `/login`, `/saved`, `/lists`, `/lists/[id]`, `/me/reviews`
- Vendor: `/claim/[vendorSlug]`, `/vendor-dashboard/[vendorSlug]/edit`
- Admin: `/admin`, `/admin/reviews`, `/admin/claims`, `/admin/categories`, `/admin/vendors`, `/admin/rating-criteria`

## Admin Merchandising
- Taxonomy management should support homepage merchandising controls for categories and subcategories.
- Admins should be able to mark a category or curated subcategory row as `featured on home`.
- Admins should be able to manage homepage row order so promoted taxonomy rows appear in a deliberate sequence.
- This should live with taxonomy/category management rather than as a separate CMS surface.

## Future Auth/Profile
- HON-114 will add provider-linked user avatars plus manual profile photo upload for email/password accounts.
- Google sign-in should hydrate the user avatar from the provider profile.
- Email/password accounts should support a first-party uploaded profile image that all app nav/profile surfaces can reuse.

## Supabase Wiring
- HON-100 establishes environment-based provider selection before real data migration begins.
- `HONESTLY_DATA_PROVIDER=mock` keeps the current in-memory app behavior.
- `HONESTLY_DATA_PROVIDER=supabase` should only be used once `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are set.
- Server-only admin work will also require `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- Until HON-101 through HON-113 land, the Supabase provider path is a validated scaffold and can still fall back to mock implementations behind the same service contracts.
- Shared Supabase helpers should live under `/lib/supabase` so browser, server, and admin clients are wired in one place.

## Auth Session Contract
- App routes should depend on provider-neutral session helpers such as `getCurrentSession()`, `requireUserSession()`, and `requireAdminSession()`.
- Route files should not be coupled to mock-specific method names.
- The data layer remains responsible for sourcing the session, while route guards stay centralized in `lib/services/session.ts`.
- HON-101 should use `/lib/supabase/auth.ts` as the integration entrypoint for Google OAuth, email OTP/password flows, logout, and Supabase session reads.

## Initial Database Shape
- HON-102 starts with a single initial schema migration under `/supabase/migrations`.
- The first schema should cover:
  - `user_profiles`
  - `categories` and `subcategories`
  - `vendors` and related location/image/social link tables
  - `rating_criteria`, `reviews`, and `review_ratings`
  - `saved_lists` and `saved_list_items`
  - `vendor_claims`
- The schema should preserve the current mock-domain concepts so service contracts can migrate without UI rewrites.

## Seed Strategy
- HON-103 should keep a checked-in `/supabase/seed.sql` that mirrors the Phase 1 mock domain closely enough for local Supabase setup.
- Seed data should include:
  - at least one user account plus one admin account
  - featured categories and subcategories
  - a representative vendor set with locations, images, and socials
  - rating criteria
  - sample reviews with criterion scores
  - saved lists and claims

## UI Direction
- Clean, airy, premium visual language.
- Subtle motion only.
- Mobile-first responsive behavior.

## Footer Policy
- Public pages use the full trust/SEO footer.
- Auth, admin, and edit/task-focused pages use no footer (or sticky minimal footer if needed later).
- Shared collection pages use the light footer variant to preserve the editorial moodboard feel.

## Next Search Tickets
- HON-014 Homepage search suggestions dropdown
- HON-015 Debounced mock-backed search service contract
- HON-016 Vendors page live service-backed search
- HON-112 Supabase-backed search implementation
- HON-113 Meilisearch upgrade path
